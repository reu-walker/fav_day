# Best Day **Ever**

Today was a really hard but really good day. My partner, _Megan_, left to go on a three week trip in Europe with another partner of hers. I'm so excited for her! At the same time I'm a bit scared. But that's life, right?

There are a lot of reasons why I'm glad she's going on the trip though.
* It's going to be fun for her
* It's her first time really going to Europe
* I'll have time to do my own adventures
* I'll get to see her when she gets back with all kinds of stories!

As her plane was leaving, I was texting with her and she said...
> I love you endlessly. Always and forever.
